# Product Brief: fcode project

## 📋 Executive Summary

**Game Account Shop** is Vietnam's first trusted marketplace for buying and selling game accounts, addressing a critical trust crisis in the country's $5-10M underground gaming economy. Currently, 70% of account trades occur through unregulated Facebook groups and Discord servers, where 60-70% of participants have experienced scams or know someone who has.

Our platform solves this problem through a **trust infrastructure** that combines verified escrow payments, seller reputation systems, and buyer protection—making account trading as safe and fast as ordering on Shopee. By focusing specifically on the Vietnamese gaming market with local payment methods (VNPay, Momo), Vietnamese language support, and mobile-first design, we address gaps that global platforms like G2G fail to serve.

Target launch begins with **Liên Minh Huyền Thoại (League of Legends)** accounts—the game with Vietnam's largest player base at ~5M users—before expanding to other titles (Valorant, FIFA, Genshin Impact). Our phased approach starts with a manual concierge MVP to validate demand, then scales through automated payment integration and multi-game expansion.

**The opportunity:** Unlock currently paralyzed transactions in a market where trust barriers prevent millions of dollars in legitimate trades annually. Success means enabling thousands of Vietnamese gamers to safely trade accounts in under 30 minutes while building a platform with defensible network effects through accumulated reputation data.

## 🎯 Core Vision

### Problem Statement

**Vietnamese gamers lose billions of đồng annually to account trading scams on unregulated Facebook groups and Discord servers.**

The current ecosystem operates with zero trust infrastructure: sellers fake screenshots, buyers ghost after receiving information, and both parties face the "send money first" vs. "give account first" dilemma with no recourse. This trust crisis creates massive transaction friction, with manual negotiations taking hours or days, and many gamers abandoning trades entirely due to fraud risk.

### Problem Impact

**For Buyers (The Busy Gamers):**
- Financial loss from scams (average 1-2 million VNĐ per incident)
- Wasted time in manual negotiation (2-3 days per successful trade)
- Inability to verify account quality before purchase
- Risk of account recovery after sale (seller reclaiming accounts)

**For Sellers (The Account Farmers):**
- Difficulty finding serious buyers (posts get buried in group feeds)
- Time wasted on non-serious inquiries (50+ messages per sale)
- Zero reputation mechanism—every transaction starts from zero trust
- No ability to charge premium for verified, high-quality accounts

**For the Market:**
- Estimated $5-10M in paralyzed transactions annually due to trust barriers
- 60-70% of gamers have experienced fraud or know someone who has
- Market fragmentation across dozens of unregulated Facebook groups
- No dominant platform serving Vietnamese gamers' specific needs

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

**Facebook Groups & Discord (Current - 70% market share):**
- Zero trust infrastructure—no verification, no escrow, no dispute resolution
- Manual negotiation creates massive time friction
- No reputation system—scammers can create new accounts instantly
- Poor searchability and discovery
- Posts get buried within hours

**Global Platforms (G2G, PlayerAuctions):**
- Not optimized for Vietnamese market (language, payment methods, popular games)
- Focus on high-value accounts ($100+) vs. Vietnam's $5-50 sweet spot
- No local community presence or understanding of Vietnamese gaming culture
- PayPal-based payments don't match VNPay/Momo preferences

**Direct Peer-to-Peer:**
- Maximum fraud risk with zero protection
- No standardized account information format
- Buyers cannot verify authenticity before purchase

### Proposed Solution

**Game Account Shop** is a trust platform that enables safe, fast game account trading through three core mechanisms:

1. **Verified Escrow System:** Buyers pay through the platform; funds are held until account verification is complete. Sellers receive payment only after buyers confirm account access—eliminating "send money first" risk.

2. **Seller Reputation Infrastructure:** Every seller accumulates ratings, verified transaction count, and dispute history. This reputation becomes portable, allowing trusted sellers to charge premiums and reducing due diligence for buyers.

3. **Admin Approval Workflow:** All submitted accounts undergo admin review before listing (checking for fake screenshots, unrealistic pricing, suspicious seller patterns) to prevent fraudulent listings from reaching the marketplace.

**Platform Features:**
- Game-specific search and filtering (by rank, level, champions, price range)
- Standardized account information templates
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Vietnamese language UI
- VNPay and Momo payment integration
- Transaction history and user dashboard

**Launch Strategy:** Begin with manual concierge MVP (manual escrow, admin-vetted listings) focusing solely on Liên Minh Huyền Thoại to validate demand and build initial reputation corpus. Scale to automated payments and multi-game expansion once achieving 20+ weekly transactions.

### Key Differentiators

**1. Local Trust Infrastructure (vs. Global Competitors):**
- Vietnamese language support and local gaming community understanding
- VNPay/Momo integration (not PayPal)
- Focus on $5-50 account sweet spot (not $100+ global market)
- Mobile-first design matching Vietnamese user behavior

**2. Reputation Moat (vs. Facebook Groups):**
- Verified seller ratings and transaction history create switching costs
- New competitors cannot replicate accumulated reputation data
- Network effects: more sellers → more buyers → more valuable platform

**3. Admin-Gated Quality (vs. Open Marketplaces):**
- All accounts reviewed before listing prevents fraud proliferation
- Higher signal-to-noise ratio than unmoderated platforms
- Creates trust premium for platform-listed accounts

**4. Phased Validation Approach (vs. Build-First Mentalities):**
- Manual concierge MVP tests demand before building complex automation
- Learning-focused: understand disputes, fraud patterns, and user needs before scaling
- Capital-efficient: prove model before significant engineering investment

**5. Platform Expansion Potential:**
- Trust infrastructure (escrow + verification + reviews) applicable to broader digital goods
- Phase 2: In-game items (skins, weapons)
- Phase 3: Boosting services
- Phase 4: General digital goods marketplace

#### **Metric Balancing Framework**

**When Metrics Conflict (Decision Hierarchy):**

1. **Trust > Growth** (Never compromise trust for speed)
   - Example: Slow approvals vs. fraud risk → Choose slower, safer

2. **Buyer Experience > Seller Revenue** (Platform exists for buyers first)
   - Example: Seller wants instant approval, buyer wants safety → Choose buyer safety

3. **Long-term Value > Short-term Revenue** (Build sustainable platform)
   - Example: Charge high fees now vs. grow user base → Choose growth

4. **Quality > Quantity** (Better fewer transactions than more bad ones)
   - Example: Approve marginal listings vs. reject for quality → Choose quality

**Metric Review Cadence:**
- **Daily:** Transaction volume, dispute alerts, admin queue
- **Weekly:** Leading indicators, seller/buyer acquisition
- **Monthly:** Retention, financials, NPS, strategic planning
